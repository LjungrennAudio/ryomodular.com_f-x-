Certainly! I'd be happy to help you choose ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters) and DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters) for your f(x) module, based on everything we've discussed. Selecting the right ADCs and DACs is crucial for achieving high-quality audio processing and precise control voltage (CV) handling in your module.

Understanding Your Requirements
1. Number of Channels
Audio Inputs: At least one or two audio inputs for processing external audio signals.
CV Inputs: Multiple CV inputs for modulation and parameter control.
Audio Outputs: At least one or two audio outputs for processed audio signals.
CV Outputs: Potentially multiple CV outputs for control signals generated by the module.
2. Resolution and Sampling Rates
Audio Signals:

High Resolution: 16-bit or higher for good audio quality.
Sampling Rate: 48 kHz or higher to cover the audio spectrum up to 20 kHz.
CV Signals:

Resolution: 12-bit may be sufficient, but higher resolution (14-bit or 16-bit) provides more precise control.
Sampling Rate: Lower than audio rates; typically, 1 kHz to 10 kHz is acceptable.
3. Interface Compatibility
SPI Interface: Preferred for simplicity and compatibility with the STM32G4's SPI peripherals.
I²S Interface: Can be used creatively to communicate with SPI DACs for efficient data transfer and precise timing.
Analog Inputs: Utilize the STM32G4's built-in ADCs for CV inputs if they meet the requirements.
4. Other Considerations
Voltage Levels: Ensure compatibility with Eurorack standards (typically ±5V for audio and 0–10V for CV signals).
Package Size and Availability: Components should be readily available and fit within the physical constraints of your module.
Power Consumption: Should be within the limits of Eurorack power supplies.

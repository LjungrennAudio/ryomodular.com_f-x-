Summary
All functions are now corrected and formatted for clarity. These mathematical expressions can be implemented in your module to offer users a variety of signal processing options. Be sure to:

Implement Proper Scaling: Ensure input and output signals are properly scaled to prevent clipping or unintended distortion, especially when dealing with exponential or logarithmic functions.

Handle Edge Cases: For functions with discontinuities or piecewise definitions, carefully manage transitions to avoid artifacts in the processed signal.

Parameter Control: Where functions include adjustable parameters (like exp in exponentiation or coefficients in polynomial shaping), design the module's interface to allow users to intuitively modify these settings, possibly via CV inputs or control knobs.

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions about these functions or need further assistance with their implementation in your module!

Here's a menu of actions for my module:

Module Action Menu:
Wavefolding:

Folding the waveform back on itself when it exceeds a certain threshold, introducing rich harmonics.
Filtering:

Apply various filters such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and notch filters to shape the frequency spectrum.
Distortion/Saturation:

Introduce non-linearities like soft clipping, hard clipping, tanh, and other methods to add harmonics and warmth.
Dynamic Range Compression/Limiting:

Control the dynamics of the audio signal using compression, limiting, and other dynamic range processing techniques.
Clipping:

Apply hard clipping or soft clipping to limit the signal, creating a more distorted or aggressive sound.
Modulation:

Amplitude modulation (AM) or frequency modulation (FM) to add movement to the sound. This could also include ring modulation and phase modulation.
Envelope Shaping:

Control the attack, decay, sustain, and release phases of a sound, shaping its dynamic progression over time.
Additional Relevant Actions:
Wave Shaping:

Apply polynomial waveshaping, sinusoidal waveshaping, or exponentiation to change the harmonic content and create new timbres from basic waveforms.
Rectification:

Use half-wave or full-wave rectification to modify the waveform by removing or flipping negative portions, introducing even harmonics.
Reverb/Delay Effects:

Add reverb or delay effects for spatial processing and adding depth to the sound.
Equalization (EQ):
Apply EQ curves to boost or cut specific frequency ranges, further shaping the tonal character of the sound.
Chorus/Flanger/Phaser (Modulation effects):
Introduce time-based modulation effects to create depth, movement, and phase interactions in the sound.
Ring Modulation:
Multiply two signals together (e.g., the audio signal and a carrier signal) to create inharmonic, metallic tones.
Pitch Shifting/Detuning:
Change the pitch of the signal, adding detuning, pitch shifting, or even octave division effects for further creative control.
Redundancies Removed:
Clipping was retained as its own action, but it overlaps with distortion/saturation, so both actions can share similar mathematical functions (like hard clipping, tanh, and saturation).
The dynamic range compression/limiting section stands on its own, and there‚Äôs no direct redundancy with other actions.

Resource Consideration: Implementing reverb may be CPU-intensive, especially on a lower-end ARM microcontroller.
Suggestion: Focus on delay effects initially; consider reverb if resources allow.

};
Implementation Details
Process Selection:

The MainController will hold a pointer to the current SignalProcess object.
When a new action is selected via the menu, the SignalProcess pointer is updated to point to an instance of the corresponding processor class.
Parameter Control:

Parameters for each processor (e.g., thresholds, gains, rates) can be controlled via CV inputs or module controls.
Implement parameter mapping functions to translate CV voltages to parameter values.
Processing Loop:

The mainLoop() method in MainController will call processSignal() on the current processor for each sample.

cpp
Copy code
void MainController::mainLoop() {
    while (true) {
        double inputSignal = signalInput.readAudioSignal();
        double processedSignal = currentProcessor->processSignal(inputSignal, currentTime);
        signalOutput.outputSignal(processedSignal);
        updateTime();
    }
}
Resource Management
Memory Usage:

Be mindful of memory constraints, especially when implementing effects like delay, reverb, and pitch shifting that require buffers.
CPU Load:

Optimize algorithms to ensure real-time processing.
Use fixed-point arithmetic if floating-point operations are too resource-intensive.
Modular Implementation:

Allow for enabling/disabling certain processors at compile-time if resource constraints become an issue.
4. Additional Considerations
Hardware Integration
Analog Inputs/Outputs:

Ensure that the ADC/DAC setup can handle the necessary sampling rates and resolutions for real-time audio processing.
Consider oversampling for effects that require higher fidelity.
CV Inputs:

Use ADC channels to read CV inputs for parameter control.
Implement smoothing filters to prevent abrupt parameter changes.
User Interface
LED Menus:

Use the MenuInterface class to navigate between actions and display the current selection.
Implement debounce logic for buttons to prevent unintended multiple triggers.
Buttons and Controls:

Assign buttons for selecting actions, adjusting parameters, and navigating menus.
Consider adding rotary encoders or potentiometers for continuous parameter adjustments.
Scalability
Adding New Actions:
The class-based architecture allows for easy addition of new processing actions by creating new derived classes of SignalProcess.
Update the menu system to include new actions as they are implemented.
Testing and Validation
Unit Tests:

Write unit tests for each processor class to ensure correctness.
Use test signals (e.g., sine waves, white noise) to validate processing algorithms.
Audio Quality:

Evaluate the audio output for artifacts, noise, and latency.
Use audio analysis tools to measure harmonic content and frequency response.

By mapping each module action to specific mathematical functions and integrating them into our C++ module framework, we've created a clear path forward for implementing your Eurorack module. This structured approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and efficient resource management.

Next Steps:

Finalize the List of Actions:

Decide which actions are essential for the initial version.

Develop Processor Classes:

Start implementing the SignalProcess derived classes, beginning with the most critical actions.
Focus on optimizing algorithms for real-time performance.
Hardware Prototyping:

Set up a development board with your chosen microcontroller and ADC/DAC components.
Begin testing signal input/output and basic processing.
User Interface Implementation:

Develop the menu system for action and function selection.
Test the responsiveness and intuitiveness of the controls.
Iterative Testing and Refinement:

Continuously test each new feature both in isolation and integrated into the main system.
Gather feedback and make adjustments as necessary.

# ryomodular_f[x]
 a possible future mpu based f(x) module


yetr another aabsolute gem of an idea for an awesome module swhich will very likely never reachy the light of day so here it will be placed just so people will know. maybe i'll return to it in futurfe and things will go somdewhere - it would be nice but at least it's not totally dead nad forgotten as long as it resides here.

we'll be working in C++ because we're going to plan initially to use a lower end arm cellphone ic - that should give us plenty of gpio and communication to hook up an appropriate adc/dac ic - could you recommend a suitable adc/dac ic setup assuming were going to have one audio in, one audio out, 1 process cv in, 1 process cv out and 5 minimum controller cv ins as well, please fren?

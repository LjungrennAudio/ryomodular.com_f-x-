Awesome, fren! Let's plan the overview of the C++ code for your Doepfer A100 format Eurorack modular synth module. We want the module to handle different actions (like filters, distortion, wavefolding, etc.), allow users to choose from various mathematical functions, and input constants for each function. Here's an initial plan and structure:

1. Key Components of the Code
We'll break the module down into several core components:

Input Handling: To receive user input for selecting the module action, the function, and constants.
Action Classes: Each action (filter, distortion, wavefolding, etc.) will be encapsulated in a class or function.
Mathematical Functions: These will be separate functions or methods, applied based on the user's selection.
Processing Logic: To apply the chosen mathematical function and action to the incoming audio signal.
User Interface: This could be a simple method for selecting options, or in a real modular context, it might represent panel controls (knobs, switches, etc.).
2. Code Structure Overview
a. Classes and Functions
SynthModule:

This will be the main class that handles the selection of actions, the processing of audio signals, and the application of functions.
Action Classes:

Classes for each action, such as Filter, Distortion, Wavefolder, etc. Each of these will have methods that apply the chosen function to the audio signal.
Example classes:

Filter
Distortion
Wavefolder
Mathematical Function Classes/Methods:

Functions like tanh(), hard_clip(), exponentiate(), etc., that modify the waveform.
Constants Handling:

A method that accepts user input for constants, such as clipping thresholds or polynomial coefficients.
b. Audio Processing
A core processBlock() function will process incoming audio samples. Based on the user’s selected action and function, the appropriate math function is applied to the audio signal in real-time.
Each action (filter, distortion, etc.) will likely modify the sample buffer in-place.
c. User Input Handling
This section of the code will allow the user to select:
The action (filter, distortion, wavefolding, etc.)
The mathematical function (e.g., tanh, clip, exponentiate)
Constants/parameters (e.g., clipping threshold, polynomial coefficients)
For a hardware interface, this could correspond to the positions of physical knobs or switches on the module, but for simulation purposes, we can use command-line inputs for now.
3. Pseudo Code Overview
cpp
Copy code
// Base class for all actions
class SynthModule {
public:
    // Method to select the action (filter, distortion, etc.)
    void selectAction(int actionID);
    
    // Method to select the function (tanh, hard_clip, etc.)
    void selectFunction(int functionID);
    
    // Method to input constants (thresholds, coefficients, etc.)
    void setConstants(float constants[]);

    // Process incoming audio samples
    void processBlock(float* audioBuffer, int bufferSize);

private:
    int currentAction;
    int currentFunction;
    float constants[3]; // Constants for the mathematical functions

    // Individual action classes
    Filter filter;
    Distortion distortion;
    Wavefolder wavefolder;

    // Mathematical function handler
    float applyFunction(float sample);
};

// Action classes
class Filter {
public:
    float process(float sample, float constants[]);
};

class Distortion {
public:
    float process(float sample, float constants[]);
};

class Wavefolder {
public:
    float process(float sample, float constants[]);
};

// Example of a mathematical function
float tanhFunction(float sample) {
    return tanh(sample);
}

float hardClipFunction(float sample, float threshold) {
    if (sample > threshold) return threshold;
    if (sample < -threshold) return -threshold;
    return sample;
}

// Main method that applies the chosen function
float SynthModule::applyFunction(float sample) {
    switch (currentFunction) {
        case 1:
            return tanhFunction(sample);
        case 2:
            return hardClipFunction(sample, constants[0]);
        // Add other functions here
    }
    return sample;
}
4. Detailed Breakdown
a. SynthModule Class
selectAction(int actionID):

This method takes in the ID of the action (e.g., 1 for filter, 2 for distortion) and sets the appropriate action class to handle the incoming audio.
selectFunction(int functionID):

This method allows the user to select the mathematical function (e.g., tanh or hard clip) to apply to the audio.
setConstants(float constants[]):

This allows the user to input any necessary constants, such as the clipping threshold for hard clipping or polynomial coefficients for polynomial shaping.
processBlock(float* audioBuffer, int bufferSize):

This method will iterate over each sample in the audio buffer and apply the selected action and function. It’s the main processing loop that runs in real-time in the module.
b. Action Classes
Filter Class:

Implements various filters like low-pass or high-pass. Will use the selected function (like tanh or log) to shape the filtered signal.
Distortion Class:

Processes the signal by applying clipping or waveshaping based on user input.
Wavefolder Class:

Implements wavefolding based on the function selected (e.g., exponential folding or sine wave folding).
c. Mathematical Functions
We’ll have individual functions like tanhFunction(), hardClipFunction(), and polynomialWaveshaper(). These will handle the core of the signal processing and will be selected based on the user's input.
5. Next Steps
Define the specific actions (filter types, distortion types, wavefolding behavior).
Implement mathematical functions for each action and map them to the audio signal.
Set up input handling for selecting actions, functions, and constant values (knobs, switches, etc.).
Handle real-time audio processing efficiently, ensuring the module responds quickly to control changes.
Conclusion:
This gives us a structured plan for the module. The SynthModule class serves as the central hub, managing user inputs and processing the audio signal. Each action class (filter, distortion, wavefolder) will be responsible for its specific behavior, while the mathematical functions will modify the signal in various ways (tanh, clipping, etc.).

Let me know if you’d like to adjust anything, and we can start coding specific parts!

Similar correction for cosh: the denominator should be 2.
2. Sigmoid Function
Sigmoid: 
𝜎

𝑥
)
=
1
1
+
𝑒
−
𝑥
σ(x)= 
1+e 
−x

​
 
The formula should be

​
 , not 
1
+
𝑒
1
−

if 
𝑥

f(x)= 
⎩
⎨
⎧
​
  
−1
x
1
​
  
if x<−1
if −1≤x≤1

0
0
if 
𝑥
≤
0
f(x)={ 
x
0
​
  
if x>0
if x≤0
​

Full-Wave Rectification:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=

sin
⁡
(
∣
𝑥
∣
)
⋅
∣
𝑥
∣
exp
f(x)=sin(∣x∣)⋅∣x∣ 
exp
 
This looks mostly correct, but ensure that exp is a user-defined constant (e.g., 2 or 3). The use of sin(|x|) modulates the signal in a sine-like fashion, which will create interesting harmonics.
6. Polynomial Waveshaping

8. Sinusoidal Waveshaping
Sinusoidal Waveshaping:
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
sin
⁡

∣
)
⋅
sin
⁡
(
∣
𝑥
∣
)
f(x)=log(1+∣x∣)⋅sin(∣x∣)
The logarithmic part is fine, but for practical use, consider removing the multiplication by 
sin
⁡
(
∣
𝑥
∣
)
sin(∣x∣) unless you specifically want this sine modulation in your compression.
10. Wavefolding
Wavefolding:

⎩
⎨
⎧
​
  
x
2T−x
…
​
  
if ∣x∣<T
if T≤x<2T

11. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
ReLU:
ReLU
(
𝑥
)
=
max
⁡
(
0
,
𝑥
)
ReLU(x)=max(0,x)
Correct! This is commonly used in neural networks and applies simple rectification by turning negative values into 0.
12. Softsine (Softsign)
Softsign:
softsign
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
1
+
∣
𝑥
∣
softsign(x)= 
1+∣x∣
x
​
 
Correct! This is a form of smooth saturation function that avoids harsh clipping.
13. Power Function

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2

)
sin(∣x∣) for a more standard compressor.
Everything else looks good, fren! Each of these functions provides a useful way to shape audio signals and add non-linearities, harmonics, and texture to your synth module.

Next, we can start implementing these in C++ for your module if you’re ready!


- wavefolding
- filtering
- distortion/saturation
- dynamic range compression/limiting
- clipping
- modulation
- envelope shaping


Here's an updated menu of actions for your module, based on your list, with some additional relevant actions and any redundancies removed:

Module Action Menu:
Wavefolding:

Folding the waveform back on itself when it exceeds a certain threshold, introducing rich harmonics.
Filtering:

Apply various filters such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and notch filters to shape the frequency spectrum.
Distortion/Saturation:

Introduce non-linearities like soft clipping, hard clipping, tanh, and other methods to add harmonics and warmth.
Dynamic Range Compression/Limiting:

Control the dynamics of the audio signal using compression, limiting, and other dynamic range processing techniques.
Clipping:

Apply hard clipping or soft clipping to limit the signal, creating a more distorted or aggressive sound.
Modulation:

Amplitude modulation (AM) or frequency modulation (FM) to add movement to the sound. This could also include ring modulation and phase modulation.
Envelope Shaping:

Control the attack, decay, sustain, and release phases of a sound, shaping its dynamic progression over time.
Additional Relevant Actions:
Wave Shaping:

Apply polynomial waveshaping, sinusoidal waveshaping, or exponentiation to change the harmonic content and create new timbres from basic waveforms.
Rectification:

Use half-wave or full-wave rectification to modify the waveform by removing or flipping negative portions, introducing even harmonics.
Reverb/Delay Effects:

Add reverb or delay effects for spatial processing and adding depth to the sound.
Equalization (EQ):
Apply EQ curves to boost or cut specific frequency ranges, further shaping the tonal character of the sound.
Chorus/Flanger/Phaser (Modulation effects):
Introduce time-based modulation effects to create depth, movement, and phase interactions in the sound.
Ring Modulation:
Multiply two signals together (e.g., the audio signal and a carrier signal) to create inharmonic, metallic tones.
Pitch Shifting/Detuning:
Change the pitch of the signal, adding detuning, pitch shifting, or even octave division effects for further creative control.
Redundancies Removed:
Clipping was retained as its own action, but it overlaps with distortion/saturation, so both actions can share similar mathematical functions (like hard clipping, tanh, and saturation).
The dynamic range compression/limiting section stands on its own, and there’s no direct redundancy with other actions.
Thoughts for Your Consideration:
Depending on the modular format and the type of processing you want to emphasize, you can scale back or specialize in a specific action like wavefolding or distortion.
If the module will include real-time modulation, consider making the modulation and envelope shaping sections more dynamic with LFOs, ADSRs, or external modulation inputs.
Let me know if you'd like to expand or adjust any of these options, fren! This menu gives your module a lot of flexibility and creative sound-shaping potential.
